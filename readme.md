# Diamond Handing

This program is built during the OPOS Hackathon.

It has only one key functionality, which is to allow deposit and withdrawal of SOL and SPL tokens into a PDA of the program. Withdrawals are allowed based on user specified conditions.

This program will be made immutable after an audit.
